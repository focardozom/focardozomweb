  description: Hey there! I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Miami studying Prevention Science and Community Health. I've been focusing on evaluating preventive programs and trying to understand alcohol use in adolescents. I also lead the data analysis department at Figura 1. I'm really interested in using statistical methods to solve a range of problems, like predicting health behavior and modeling social networks. It's all pretty exciting stuff!

title: About me
---

I am originally from Colombia. I graduated from La Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where I study psychology. Then I did a master's in psychology at La Universidad de Los Andes. Then, I moved to Miami to do a Ph.D. in Prevention Science and Community Health.

Meanwhile, I worked with Corporacion Nuevos Rumbos, where I researched the prevention of drug use in adolescents. Nowadays, I am a data scientist in Figura 1, a company created to evaluate social programs. 

I like to play chess and read (biographies, philosophy, statistics, and fiction) in my free time.

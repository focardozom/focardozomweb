title: About me
---
I'm a psychologist from La Universidad Nacional de Colombia and have a Master's degree in Psychology from La Universidad de Los Andes. I'm currently working on my Ph.D. in Prevention Science and Community Health at a university in Miami to further my expertise in the field. In the past, I worked with Corporacion Nuevos Rumbos on research to prevent drug use in adolescents and also taught stats and program evaluation at la Universidad del Bosque in Colombia. Right now, I'm a data scientist at Figura 1, a company that evaluates social programs. In my free time, I like to play chess and read all sorts of books - biographies, philosophy, statistics, fiction, you name it!
